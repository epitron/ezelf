Thank you for installing has_many_polymorphs!

There is an experimental tagging system generator in place.

  ./script/generator tagging TaggableModel1 TaggableModel2 [..]

You can use the flags --skip-migration and/or --self-referential.

Tests will be generated, but will not work unless you have at
least 2 fixture entries for each taggable model. Their ids must
be 1 and 2.
