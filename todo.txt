=== BUGS ===

* Automatically handle 
 - Se?or Coconut - Fiesta Songs/Senor Coconut - 01 - Smoke on the Water.mp3
./app/models/source.rb:26:in `iconv': "\361or Coconut - Fi"... (Iconv::IllegalSequence)
        from ./app/models/source.rb:26:in `properly_encode_path'

* For sources.encoding, give the user a dropdown of common encodings (w/ explanation):
    - UTF-8
    - ISO-8859-1 (DOS/NTFS)

    
* Playlists have blank lines between entries!

=== Major Features ============================

  * Upload/Mass Import wizard
  * Listening History
  * Tag Editor (with Metadata Revisions? eg. dump ID3 blob to a table somewhere)
  * Importer Improved (treat DIRs as albums)
  * Forums (beast integration?) or Comments
  * Covers
  * Bittorrent (Azureus, rTorrent -> http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide)

=== ezElf ============================

* UI improvements:
  - [list view], [cover view]
  - hovering over CD icons shows album name
  - icon for "5-disc" chunks
  - "music" section, with tabs for albums/artists/dirs
  - re-collapse Artists

* Search improvements:
  - "party ben" should find "partyben"

* Better tag reader (fast too!): http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/hiki.cgi?Gst%3A%3ATag

* Integration with MusicBrainz.org and Audioscrobbler.net
  |_ add "mbid" to all tracks/artists/albums in the database (and id3v2 tags?)
  |_ [AS] "tags" for each track/album/artist
  |_ [MB/AS] cover art
  |_ [AS] related artists
  |_ [AS] submit tracks

* browse/artists => display albums in main list (expand only expands tracks)
  

* RESTify!
        browse/albums/ => albums/
        browse/artists/ => artists/

* Groups (polymorphic containers for albums, tracks, people, or other groups)

* "Album Artist" should come from as many fields as possible
  (TPE2, TOPE, TCOM), but the web tag-editor should pick one
  (how about the one that EasyTag prefers! :D)

* Simple helpers for doing Ajax stuff
  |_ expand_button (object, action)
  |_ collapse_button (object)

* Restfulness!
  |_ /tracks/102 => info
  |_ /tracks/102;edit => edit
  |_ /tracks/102.mp3 => stream
  |_ /tracks/102.mp3;session=a8d9fyu9823h89fh2w3f98h => authenticated stream
  |_ /albums/298 => info
  |_ /albums/298;edit => edit all tags
  |_ /albums/298.m3u => playlist
  |_ /albums/298.zip => download it

* HISTORY view
  |_ praise good tracks ( \o/ ) / scold bad tracks ( >:R )
  |_ connect together tracks that "sound good together"

* On the site, have "You are currently listening to: ..." at the top
  |_ ajax auto-refresh! :D OR, push-based javascript updates

* Custom cookies and user identification system
  * before_filter that associates a unique user with a unique key (short, like tinyurl) and looks up their account
  * /stream/track should accept the user key in the url to retrieve the session (or use IP if it's missing)
    |_ "http://<big key>@<hostname>/stream/<track id>.mp3"
    |_ add "last_ip" to User model

* Flag top-3 tracks with a thumbs-up icon

* Associate artists, albums, or songs by linking "what sounds good together"

* Ajaxiness (things expand!)

* Compute track length for each mp3
    MP3 Header Format:

        http://home.swipnet.se/grd/mp3info/frmheader/index.html

        This site also details a class in C, which reads the header and returns the data in more manageable variable types.

        number_of_frames = File.size / FrameLengthInBytes
        length of mp3 (seconds) = number of frames / (423/11 or 38.4545)


* Browse music by Filesystem
  * add "path[]" to Track model (split the filename)
    |_ peraps add: "dir", "dirs[]", "root", and "filename", and make "path" == dir+root+filename


=== vsftpd Config ===========================

Q) Help! Does vsftpd support virtual users?
A) Yes, via PAM integration. Set "guest_enable=YES" in /etc/vsftpd.conf. This
has the effect of mapping every non-anonymous successful login to the local
username specified in "guest_username". Then, use PAM and (e.g.) its pam_userdb
module to provide authentication against an external (i.e. non-/etc/passwd)
repository of users.
Note - currently there is a restriction that with guest_enable enabled, local
users also get mapped to guest_username.
There is an example of virtual users setup in the "EXAMPLE" directory.

Q) Help! Does vsftpd support different settings for different users?
A) Yes - in a very powerful way. Look at the setting "user_config_dir" in the
manual page.

=== libid3-ruby Extensions ==============

Reference: http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames
           http://id3lib-ruby.rubyforge.org/doc/index.html

* New attributes:
        album_artist (:TPE2)
        composer (:TCOM)
        original_artist (:TOPE)


=== Tangential things ==========================

Python Paste is an awesome way of composing applications. Ruby currently
doesn't have anything like that. How difficult would it be to create
something like that for Rails?

Issues:
  * Shared things (authentication) => natively supported by framework?
